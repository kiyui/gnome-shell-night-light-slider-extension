## preferences

![extension preferences](./images/preferences.gif)

The extension can be customized with the following preferences:

- Change the slider position in the aggregate menu, either at the top-level or in the Night Light submenu
- Always have the slider shown, even when the Night Light is disabled
- Toggle the indicator visibility
- Swap the axis of the slider
- Sync Night Light slider percentage with brightness (albeit not vice-versa, works well on laptops with well tuned temperature ranges)
- Enable permanent Night Light via having a timer constantly shift and update the Night Light schedule
- Adjust minimum and maximum temperature values

## installation

Available from GNOME extensions website [here](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1276/night-light-slider/), make sure to enable Night Light under Settings/Display
